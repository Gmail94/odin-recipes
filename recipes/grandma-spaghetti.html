            <li><strong>Cook Italian sausage.</strong> In a large pot, begin browning Italian sausage over medium heat, making sure to break up the meat into small crumbles. 
                Add the chopped onion and cook until it’s softened.</li>
            <li><strong>Add other ingredients and simmer.</strong> Stir in the garlic, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, basil, parsley, brown sugar, salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper. Bring the meat sauce to a low boil. Stir in red wine. 
                Simmer on low, stirring occasionally, for at least an hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the pasta.</strong> When you’re ready to eat and the meat sauce is about done cooking, cook the pasta according to package instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve and enjoy.</strong> Plate drained spaghetti noodles (or other favorite pasta) and spoon meat sauce over the top and sprinkle with parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley or fresh basil. 
                Whip up a fresh Italian salad and garlic bread for a complete dinner!</li>
